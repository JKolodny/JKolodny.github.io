<h1>about me</h1>



<p>
For a while, I wrote some stuff on substack
but am not the largest fan of the interface.
It takes the uniqueness out of blogs, there doesn't
seem to be a ton of engagement if you don't bring a
following to the site. With that in mind, if no one is reading
anyway, why not do my own thing and get a little creative?

    <pre>
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np

        def add(x, y):
            df['col'].apply(lambda x: str(x) + "test!")
            return x + y

    </pre>
